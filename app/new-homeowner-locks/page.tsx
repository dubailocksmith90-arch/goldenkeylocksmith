  { q: 'Why should I rekey my locks when I move into a new house?', a: 'The previous owners, their family members, contractors, real estate agents, and anyone else who was given a key may still have access to your home. Rekeying ensures only you and those you authorize can enter.' },
  { q: 'How much does it cost to rekey a whole house in Dallas TX?', a: 'Whole-house rekeying typically costs $99–$149 for 3–5 exterior locks. This is nearly always the most cost-effective option compared to replacing all the hardware, which could run $400–$1,000+.' },
  { q: 'Should I rekey or replace my locks?', a: 'Rekey if your locks are in good condition and are quality brands (Schlage, Kwikset, etc.). Replace if the locks are old, damaged, low-grade, or if you want to upgrade security or aesthetics.' },
  { q: 'Do you rekey all locks to the same key?', a: 'Yes, that is the default and the most convenient option — one key for all your exterior doors. We can also key locks differently if you prefer separate keys (e.g., for an in-law suite).' },
  { q: 'How long does whole-house rekeying take?', a: 'Most whole-house rekeys (3–5 locks) take 45–90 minutes. We come to your home, remove the lock cylinders, rekey them on-site, reinstall, and provide you with new keys.' },

                <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">Buying a new home is exciting — but you should never assume you&apos;re the only one with a key. Previous owners, their family, contractors, real estate agents, and house cleaners may all have copies. Rekeying your locks is the single most important security step you can take on day one — and it costs less than $150 for most homes.</p>

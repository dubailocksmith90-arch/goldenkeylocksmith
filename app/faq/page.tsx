      { q: 'Do you charge more for after-hours or emergency service?', a: 'No. We charge the same flat rates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including holidays. Our rates are transparent and do not change based on time of day.' },

    faqs: [

  {
    group: 'Licensing & Credentials',
    faqs: [
      { q: 'Are you licensed in Texas?', a: 'Yes. All our technicians hold a Texas TACLA (Texas Alarm License Act) license issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety. This is required for all locksmith work in Texas.' },

  {
    group: 'Rekeying vs. Replacing Locks',
    faqs: [
      { q: 'What is rekeying?', a: 'Rekeying is the process of changing the internal pins inside a lock cylinder so that the old key no longer works and a new key is required. The lock hardware stays the same — only the key combination changes.' },
      { q: 'Should I rekey or replace my locks when moving in?', a: 'Rekeying is almost always the better choice. Same security, fraction of the cost ($15–$35/lock vs $80–$200+ to replace). Only replace if locks are old, damaged, or below ANSI Grade 1 quality.' },
      { q: 'How many keys do I get when rekeying?', a: 'We provide as many keys as you need. Standard service includes 2 keys. Additional keys can be cut on-site for $5–$15 each.' },
    ],
  },
  {
    group: 'Car Keys & Automotive',
    faqs: [
      { q: 'Can you make a car key without the original?', a: 'Yes. We can cut car keys from the VIN number and program transponder keys and key fobs without the original key for most vehicle makes and models.' },
      { q: 'How much cheaper are you than the dealer for car keys?', a: 'Typically 30–60% cheaper. Dealers often charge $250–$600 for transponder or smart key programming. We typically charge $75–$250 for the same service, on-site at your location.' },
      { q: 'What car brands do you service?', a: 'We service most domestic and import vehicles including Toyota, Honda, Ford, Chevrolet, Nissan, Hyundai, Kia, Jeep, Dodge, RAM, GMC, Mazda, Subaru, Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Lexus, Acura, and more.' },
    ],
  },
  {
    group: 'Commercial Locksmith',
    faqs: [
      { q: 'Can you work on commercial buildings and businesses?', a: 'Yes. We provide full commercial locksmith services including office lockouts, master key systems, access control installation, high-security lock upgrades, and panic bar / exit device installation.' },
      { q: 'Do you work on apartment complexes?', a: 'Yes. We service apartment buildings for both individual tenant lockouts and property-wide rekeying or master key system projects. We coordinate with property managers for larger projects.' },
